Project Title: CSE201 Advanced Programming Assignments

Author(s): Varun Bharti

Description:

This repository contains all the completed assignments for the CSE201: Advanced Programming course. This course focused on building strong programming skills for large-scale applications, emphasizing concepts like:

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Designing programs with classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
* Reusable Code Design: Creating modular and reusable code components to improve maintainability and efficiency.
* Test-Driven Development (TDD): Writing tests before code implementation for better quality and reliability.
* Programming to APIs: Utilizing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to interact with external services.
* Design Patterns: Implementing common design patterns for solving recurring programming problems.
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my understanding of these concepts by providing solutions to various programming tasks assigned throughout the course.

Course Description:

The Advanced Programming course builds upon the foundation of introductory programming and equips students with the ability to design and implement complex applications. Key aspects of the course include:

* Object-Oriented Design: Learning to model real-world entities and relationships using object-oriented principles.
* Large-Scale Applications: Developing programs with multiple, independent components for improved organization and scalability.
* Teamwork: Preparing students for collaborative development efforts in team settings.
Assignments:

Individual assignment folders are included within this repository, each containing the code and additional resources (e.g., test cases, documentation) for a specific assignment.
